# Predicting the Length of Stay in ICU
In this project, we will identify key risk factors of ICU stay with four different models.
12 explanatory variables (clinical and demographic) and 2 outcome variables (length stay and length of stay group) of 2,234 patient records were used to build Elastic Net regression model, Regression Tree model, Random Forest regression, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models.

## Instructions
Download and run the `FinalProject_notebook_Team7.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab. It will automatically clone this repository and copy all the datasets.
